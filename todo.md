## Ear Training as an ML platform:

# Introduction:
- Outline motivation for project (improvisation, free will, realtime performance, logical transformations vs learned actions, …) and show clips of jazz musicians talking about improvisation theory
- Show George Benson clip as goal

# Methodology:
- Talk about how you needed to start over from the ground up using first principals
- Outline the machine learning analogy work is based on
- Show clips from original demo video

# Results:
- Video of George Benson-esque improvisation demo


## Analogy:

Model —-> Human Brain

Dataset —> YouTube, Spotify

Automatic Labeling —> Models to derive ground truth for human training (chord, melody, key, beat, phrases)

Training Job —> looping over song, accepting user input, delivering feedback

Human Labeling —> e.g., crowd-sourced corrections on Chordify

Human Review —> e.g., user manually discarding song that wasn’t transcribed well
